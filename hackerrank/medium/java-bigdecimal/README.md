# Java BigDecimal

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!

Given an array, $s$, of $n$ real number strings, sort them in descending order &mdash; but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that $.1$ is printed as $.1$, and $0.1$ is printed as $0.1$. If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g., $.1 \equiv 0.1$), then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).

Complete the code in the unlocked section of the editor below. You must rearrange array $s$'s elements according to the instructions above.

**Input Format**

The first line consists of a single integer, $n$, denoting the number of integer strings.		
Each line $i$ of the $n$ subsequent lines contains a real number denoting the value of $s_i$.

**Constraints**

* $1 \le n \le 200$ 
* Each $s_i$ has *at most* $300$ digits.


**Output Format**

Locked stub code in the editor will print the contents of array $s$ to stdout. You are only responsible for reordering the array's elements.

```java


       Arrays.sort(s, 0, n, new Comparator<String>() {
    public int compare(String a, String b) {
        BigDecimal x = new BigDecimal(a);
        BigDecimal y = new BigDecimal(b);

        return y.compareTo(x);
        }
  });


```
