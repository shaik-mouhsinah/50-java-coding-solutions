# Java Stack

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

In computer science, a stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added.(Wikipedia)


A string containing only parentheses is balanced if the following is true:
1. if it is an empty string
2. if A and B are correct, AB is correct,
3. if A is correct, (A) and {A} and [A] are also correct.


Examples of some correctly balanced strings are: "{}()",  "[{()}]",  "({()})" <br>

Examples of some unbalanced strings are: "{}(",  "({)}",  "[[",  "}{" etc.<br>

 
Given a string, determine if it is balanced or not. 




**Input Format**

There will be multiple lines in the input file, each having a single non-empty string. You should read input till end-of-file.

The part of the code that handles input operation is already provided in the editor.

**Output Format**

For each case, print 'true' if the string is balanced, 'false' otherwise.

```java
import java.util.*;
class Solution{
	
	public static void main(String []argh)
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		while (sc.hasNext()) {
			String input=sc.next();
            Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();
boolean balanced = true;

for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {

    char ch = input.charAt(i);

    if (ch == '(' || ch == '{' || ch == '[') {
        stack.push(ch);
    } 
    else {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            balanced = false;
            break;
        }

        char top = stack.pop();

        if ((ch == ')' && top != '(') ||
            (ch == '}' && top != '{') ||
            (ch == ']' && top != '[')) {
            balanced = false;
            break;
        }
    }
}

if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
    balanced = false;
}

System.out.println(balanced);
		}
		
	}
}
