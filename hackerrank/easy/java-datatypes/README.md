# Java Datatypes

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Java has 8 primitive data types; *char, boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double*. For this exercise, we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (*byte, short, int,* and *long*):

* A *byte* is an 8-bit signed integer.
* A *short* is a 16-bit signed integer.
* An *int* is a 32-bit signed integer.
* A *long* is a 64-bit signed integer.

Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.

To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor.

**Reference:** https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, $T$, denoting the number of test cases.		
Each test case, $T$, is comprised of a single line with an integer, $n$, which can be arbitrarily large or small.

**Output Format**

For each input variable $n$ and appropriate primitive $dataType$, you must determine if the given primitives are capable of storing it. If yes, then print: 

	n can be fitted in:
    * dataType
    
If there is more than one appropriate data type, print each one on its own line and order them by size (i.e.: $byte < short < int < long$).

If the number cannot be stored in one of the four aforementioned primitives, print the line:

	n can't be fitted anywhere.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int t = sc.nextInt();

        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {

            String value = sc.next();

            try {
                long n = Long.parseLong(value);

                System.out.println(value + " can be fitted in:");

                if (n >= -128 && n <= 127) {
                    System.out.println("* byte");
                }

                if (n >= -32768 && n <= 32767) {
                    System.out.println("* short");
                }

                if (n >= -2147483648L && n <= 2147483647L) {
                    System.out.println("* int");
                }

                System.out.println("* long");

            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println(value + " can't be fitted anywhere.");
            }
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
